# Overview of Project
Many current employees at Pewlett Hackard are about to reach retirement age. I was asked to create an analysis to determine the number of retiring employees per title at Pewlett Hackard and identify the employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on their age.

Programs used: PgAdmin 4, PostGreSQL 14, and Visual Studio Code 1.50.0
